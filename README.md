# 🇮🇹 Italian Codriver for Pacenote Plugin

Welcome to this repository dedicated to the development of my **Italian codriver voice pack** for the [**Pacenote Plugin**](https://github.com/WorkerBeeRI3W/PacenotePlugin) by *Workerbee*.

This project is based on **Jannemod V3**, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to **Janne Laahanen** for kindly granting me access to his IDs, which significantly improves this package's compatibility with his mod.
