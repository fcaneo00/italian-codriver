Greetings! Welcome to my repository dedicated to the development of my Italian codriver for the Pacenote Plugin (by Workerbee). This codriver is built upon Jannemod V3, and I'm grateful to Janne Laahanen for generously granting me access to his IDs, enhancing the compatibility of this package with his Jannemod.

A special thanks goes to [BlauGregg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ffYHLU_iJk83N4Q7RPybQ) for offering detailed guidance on the intricacies of the Pacenote plugin and providing insights on the necessary adjustments within the various .ini files.

I would also like to express my gratitude to the RSF community for their warmth and support.
