# italian-codriver

Hello, this is my repository for developing my italian-codriver for Pacenote Plugin (by Workerbee). This codriver is based on Jannemod V3, thanks to Janne Laahanen for letting me have access to his IDs so this package can have more compatibility with his Jannemod, thanks to BlauGregg (<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ffYHLU_iJk83N4Q7RPybQ>) for explaining me in detail how Pacenote plugin works and what to change in all those .ini files, thanks to RSF community for being so nice and providing always new and both competitive and funny rallies.
